## Installation

> #### Tested with node version 18.7.0
Install on the same computer which is running Bitwig.

From the command line:
1. In the <code>/app</code> folder, run <code>npm install</code>
2. In the <code>/app/web</code> folder, run <code>npm install</code>
3. Both folders should now have `node_modules` folders with npm libraries installed
4. Add the contents of <code>/controller-scripts</code> to your Bitwig Controller Scripts folder

## Running the Application From Source

1. In the <code>/app</code> folder, start the Node.js server with <code>node .</code>
2. A URL will be displayed in the terminalâ€”this is the address to open in your web browser. A log message will be printed to the terminal when you are successfully connected. You will want to open the browser page on a remote computer, but in the same local network as the computer running Bitwig. The URL of the page is likely to be something like http://192.168.1.x:8888 

## Packaging as a Standalone

1. Install pkg using <code>npm install -g pkg</code>
2. To package for mac, in the `/app` folder run <code>pkg . --targets node18-macos-x64</code> (assumes use of node v18.x.x)

## Running as a Standalone

In the <code>/app</code> folder, run <code>./remotewig</code>, or double click on the `remotewig` executable file which has been created in the `app` folder. You can move it to another location on your computer if required.
